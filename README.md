- I am Sean, and I have no clue what I am doing
- Actually I am not a coder, but am looking to network with a few app coders that might want to take on a project with me.  
- I have a passion for sports research.  The problem is, most research is done in the lab with very expesive equeipment.  But now that consumer technoloy had caught up, I believe we can revolutionize the way we look at sports and athletes.
